# insta_python
Customized Python CLI Script built on [LevPasha's / Instagram-API-python]

Allows you to log in, upload content, and log out of accounts.
Integrated with Google Sheets API, you can not-so-safely put batch login credentials to pull from.
The script however, will salt and encrypt-decrypt credentials for use.

Required files
- credentials.json
- client_secrets.json
